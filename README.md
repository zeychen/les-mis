# Les Miserables Character Visualization Graph
This project uses Unity as a platform to visualize the connection between characters within Les Miserables.

## Systems Needed

## Controls and Usage
- Use W,A,S,D or the arrow keys to move the camera view of the cluster up, left, down, and right.
- Holding the right-mouse-click while using the up/down arrows or W/S will move the camera towards and away from the cluster.
- Holding the space bar will increase the camera movement speed
- Use the left-mouse-click and drag to rotate the cluster
- Hovering over a node in the cluster will turn the node red and display the name of the character
